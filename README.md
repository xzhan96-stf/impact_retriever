# Head Impact Retriever
This repository is associated with "AI-based identification of head impact locations, speeds, and force based on head kinematics in contact sports".

In this study, we developed a series of LSTM models to estimate the head impact information (speed and orientation) and impact force. The code and data used for this project is stored in this repository.
